# Basic-Eshop-Cart
At this short project i built a very basic Eshop Interface with a Cart function 💻🛒
There are products(name, price), that can be added to a cart. The cart gives you the total amount of items in it, products data, the subtotal, taxes and total price. There is also a clear Cart function.

My main purpose was to practice with Javascript:

👉🏼 Arrays and Object handling 
👉🏼 Learn more about methods (push, reduce)
👉🏼 Proper use of EventListeners and Event Delegation

Iw ould definetely return in a similar project to implement: 

Responsive Images for the products
Quantity manipulation
Local Storage Data
